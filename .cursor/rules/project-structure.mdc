## Grid Tour Creator â€“ Project Structure

This is a PHP CodeIgniter 3 application.

- **Frontend view**: [`application/views/collage_editor.php`](mdc:application/views/collage_editor.php)
- **Main controller**: [`application/controllers/Collage.php`](mdc:application/controllers/Collage.php)
- **Routing**: [`application/config/routes.php`](mdc:application/config/routes.php)
- **Framework bootstrap**: [`index.php`](mdc:index.php), framework core in [`system/`](mdc:system)

### Entry flow
- Default route points to `collage` controller `index` method, which renders the collage editor view.
- The editor posts to `collage/generate` for server-side image rendering via GD.

### Conventions
- Use CodeIgniter helpers/loader APIs and keep business logic in controllers or libraries.
- Keep assets embedded or external via CDN as in the editor view; no build step required.
